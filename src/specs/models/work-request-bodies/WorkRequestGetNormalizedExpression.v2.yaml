      The configuration of cellSets to subset by, split into 4 classifications for cell sets: louvain, sample, (user defined) metadata and custom cell sets
      The result will have the intersection, all the cells that are included by all of these classifications.
      
      If any of the classifications has an empty list, it means all of the cellIds are included by that classification.
